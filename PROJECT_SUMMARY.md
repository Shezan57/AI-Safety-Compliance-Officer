# AI Safety Compliance Officer - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

**The AI Safety Compliance Officer** is an intelligent construction site monitoring system that automatically detects PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) violations and generates OSHA-compliant incident reports using AI.

## 💡 The Problem It Solves

Small construction firms face significant challenges:
- **Compliance Burden**: Daily safety reports are mandatory but time-consuming
- **Costly Fines**: OSHA violations result in hefty penalties
- **Resource Constraints**: Site managers are too busy for manual documentation
- **Unreported Incidents**: Violations go undocumented due to administrative overhead

## ✨ The Solution

A three-layer automated system:

### 1. Vision Layer (YOLOv8)
- Real-time CCTV monitoring
- Detects PPE violations: helmets, vests, goggles, gloves, boots
- High-confidence detection with bounding boxes
- Automatic screenshot capture

### 2. Agent Layer (LangChain + GPT-4)
- AI-powered report generation
- Professional legal language
- OSHA regulation references
- Contextual incident descriptions
- Recommended corrective actions

### 3. Action Layer (Automation)
- PDF report generation with evidence
- Email notifications to site managers
- SQLite database logging
- Violation history tracking

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
CCTV Feed → YOLOv8 Detection → Violation Found?
                                      ↓ YES
                           LangChain AI Agent
                                      ↓
                        Generate Formal Report
                                      ↓
                              Create PDF
                                      ↓
                        Send Email + Save to DB
```
